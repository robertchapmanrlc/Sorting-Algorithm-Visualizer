# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Understanding how sorting algorithms work can be very difficult. Visual aids can be really helpful to see how they operate. Use [this](https://sorting-algorithm-visualizer-delta.vercel.app) web app to visualize Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort in action. You can change the number of bars to sort and how fast the bars are sorted.
